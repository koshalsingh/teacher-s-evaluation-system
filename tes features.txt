
    The teacher evaluation system must have the two purposes of improving as well as measuring teaching effectiveness. The system should focus on improving teaching as well as accountability—improved student learning.
    The system should be based on teacher standards that define teaching and teacher quality.
    The system must be linked with professional development. Providing feedback to teachers on their performance is meaningless if there are no opportunities provided to learn and practice new skills.
    Because teaching is complex, it cannot be measured by just one or two tools. The system must include multiple sources of information on teachers’ effectiveness such as observations, student evaluations of teachers, parent surveys, teacher self-report measures, teacher portfolios, and evidence of student learning.
    A career ladder as well as merit pay for teachers should be in place to recognize and reward teaching excellence.
    All evaluators should be well trained and knowledgeable so that the evaluations are credible and conducted with expertise.
    Serious evaluations require time and money. We must spend to get teacher evaluation right, and effective evaluation systems require a budget to support and sustain them.
    A top-down evaluation system can create resistance among teachers. Effective evaluation systems must be designed in partnership with teachers participating from the beginning.
    A teacher evaluation system must take into account the external factors that impact teachers’ performance and effectiveness. One factor is the conditions of teaching in an institution, such as class size. These conditions may vary from one workplace to another and thus, an educator who is an effective teacher in one context may be less effective in a teaching context with different, or more difficult conditions. Other factors that affect teacher practices are culture, teaching traditions. and examinations systems.
